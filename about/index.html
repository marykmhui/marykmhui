			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I'm a journalist and researcher covering Chinaâ€™s industrial strategies. During my five years at Quartz, I provided extensive coverage of the Hong Kong protests and China's ensuing crackdown. I also report on industrial and supply chain strategies, and how those play out in the US-China competition. In addition, I conduct open-source research on Chinese industrial programs and technological capabilities. My research and analysis have appeared in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and the Economist Intelligence Unit.<p>
			As a freelance reporter, my work has appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>CityLab</i>, and <i>South China Morning Post</i>. Previously, I spent 10 months at the <i>Washington Post</i>.<p>
			I'm a member of the Alumni Advisory Board of the University Press Club at Princeton University. I was also previously a board member and press freedom committee member of the Foreign Correspondents' Club, Hong Kong.<p>
			I have a bachelor's degree in Spanish and politics from Princeton University, and attended Li Po Chun United World College for high school.</p>
